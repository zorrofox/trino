The glossary contains a list of key Trino terms and definitions.

.. _glossCatalog:

Catalog
    Catalogs define and name a configuration for connecting to a data source,
    allowing users to query the connected data. Each catalog's configuration
    specifies a :ref:`connector <glossConnector>` to define which data source
    the catalog connects to. For more information about catalogs, see
    :ref:`trino-concept-catalog`.

.. _glossCA:

Certificate Authority (CA)
    A trusted organization that signs and issues certificates. Its signatures
    can be used to verify the validity of :ref:`certificates <glossCert>`.

.. _glossCert:

Certificate
    A public key `certificate
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate>`_ issued by a
    :ref:`CA <glossCA>`, sometimes abbreviated as cert, that verifies the
    ownership of a server's private keys. Certificate format is specified in the
    `X.509 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509>`_ standard.

Cluster
    A Trino cluster provides the resources to run queries against numerous data
    sources. Clusters define the number of nodes, the configuration for the JVM
    runtime, configured data sources, and others aspects. For more information,
    see :ref:`trino-concept-cluster`.

.. _glossConnector:

Connector
    Translates data from a data source into Trino schemas, tables, columns,
    rows, and data types. A :doc:`connector </connector>` is specific to a data
    source, and is used in :ref:`catalog <glossCatalog>` configurations to
    define what data source the catalog connects to. A connector is one of many
    types of :ref:`plugins <glossPlugin>`

Container
    A lightweight virtual package of software that contains libraries, binaries,
    code, configuration files, and other dependencies needed to deploy an
    application. A running container does not include an operating system,
    instead using the operating system of the host machine. To learn more, read
    read about `containers <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/>`_
    in the Kubernetes documentation.

.. _glossDataVirtualization:

Data virtualization
    `Data virtualization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_virtualization>`_
    is a method of abstracting an interaction with multiple
    :ref:`heterogeneous data sources <glossDataSource>`, without needing to know
    the distributed nature of the data, its format, or any other technical
    details involved in presenting the data.

.. _glossDataSource:

Data source
    A system from which data is retrieved, for example, PostgreSQL or Iceberg on S3
    data. In Trino, users query data sources with :ref:`catalogs <glossCatalog>`
    that connect to each source. See :ref:`trino-concept-data-sources` for more
    information.

.. _glossGzip:

gzip
    `gzip <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip>`_ is a compression format and
    software that compresses and decompresses files. This format is used several
    ways in Trino, including deployment and compressing files in
    :ref:`object storage <glossObjectStorage>`. The most common extension for
    gzip-compressed files is ``.gz``.

.. _glossHDFS:

HDFS
    `Hadoop Distributed Filesystem (HDFS) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop#HDFS>`_
    is a scalable :ref:`open source <glossOpenSource>` filesystem that was one
    of the earliest distributed big data systems created to store large amounts
    of data for the
    `Hadoop ecosystem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop>`_.

.. _glossJKS:

Java KeyStore (JKS)
    The system of public key cryptography supported as one part of the Java
    security APIs. The legacy JKS system recognizes keys and
    :ref:`certificates <glossCert>` stored in *keystore* files, typically with
    the ``.jks`` extension, and by default relies on a system-level list of
    :ref:`CAs <glossCA>` in *truststore* files installed as part of the current
    Java installation.

Key
    A cryptographic key specified as a pair of public and private strings
    generally used in the context of :ref:`TLS <glossTLS>` to secure public
    network traffic.

.. _glossLB:

Load Balancer (LB)
    Software or a hardware device that sits on a network edge and accepts
    network connections on behalf of servers behind that wall, distributing
    traffic across network and server infrastructure to balance the load on
    networked services.

.. _glossObjectStorage:

Object Storage
    `Object storage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage>`_ is a file
    storage mechanism that stores data in a flat namespace, as opposed
    to hierarchical filesystems. Files written in object storage are immutable,
    meaning you cannot update a file but just overwrite or replace the entire
    file. In the context of Trino, object storage commonly refers to
    `cloud storage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage#Cloud_storage>`_
    technologies such as `Amazon S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3>`_,
    `Google Cloud Storage <https://cloud.google.com/storage>`_, and
    `Azure Blob Storage <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs>`_.
    In addition to cloud-hosted services, there are also local object storage
    options such as `MinIO <https://min.io/>`_ and
    `Ceph <https://docs.ceph.com>`_ that are compatible with S3. Object storage
    became a popular replacement to :ref:`HDFS <glossHDFS>`.

.. _glossOpenSource:

Open-source
    Typically refers to
    `open-source software <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software>`_.
    which is software that has the source code made available for others to see,
    use, and contribute to. Allowed usage varies depending on the license that
    the software is licensed under. Trino is licensed under the
    `Apache license <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License>`_, and is
    therefore maintained by a community of contributors from all across the
    globe.

.. _glossPlugin:

Plugin
    A bundle of code implementing the Trino
    :doc:`Service Provider Interface (SPI) </develop/spi-overview>` that is used
    to add new :ref:`connectors <glossConnector>`,
    :doc:`data types </develop/types>`, :doc:`functions`,
    :doc:`access control implementations </develop/system-access-control>`, and
    other features of Trino.

.. _glossPEM:

PEM file format
    A format for storing and sending cryptographic keys and certificates. PEM
    format can contain both a key and its certificate, plus the chain of
    certificates from authorities back to the root :ref:`CA <glossCA>`, or back
    to a CA vendor's intermediate CA.

.. _glossPKCS12:

PKCS #12
    A binary archive used to store keys and certificates or certificate chains
    that validate a key. `PKCS #12 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12>`_
    files have ``.p12`` or ``.pfx`` extensions. This format is a less popular
    alternative to :ref:`PEM <glossPEM>`.

Presto and PrestoSQL
    The old name for Trino. To learn more about the name change to Trino, read
    `the history <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trino_(SQL_query_engine)#History>`_.

Query Federation
  A type of :ref:`data virtualization <glossDataVirtualization>` that provides a
  common access point and data model across two or more heterogeneous data
  sources. A popular data model used by many query federation engines is
  translating different data sources to :ref:`SQL <glossSQL>` tables.

.. _glossSSL:

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
    Now superseded by :ref:`TLS <glossTLS>`, but still recognized as the term
    for what TLS does.

.. _glossSQL:

Structured Query Language (SQL)
    The standard language used with relational databases. For more information,
    see :doc:`SQL </language>`.

Tarball
    A common abbreviation for
    `TAR file <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)>`_, which is a
    common software distribution mechanism. This file format is a collection of
    multiple files distributed as a single file, commonly compressed using
    :ref:`gzip <glossGzip>` compression.

.. _glossTLS:

Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    `TLS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>`_ is a
    security protocol designed to provide secure communications over a network.
    It is the successor to :ref:`SSL <glossSSL>`, and used in many applications
    like HTTPS, email, and Trino. These security topics use the term TLS to
    refer to both TLS and SSL.
